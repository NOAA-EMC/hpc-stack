# hpc-stack

This repository provides a unified, shell script based build system
for building the software stack needed for the NOAA [Universal Forecast
System (UFS)](https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-weather-model) and
related products, and applications written for the [Joint Effort for
Data assimilation Integration
(JEDI)](https://jointcenterforsatellitedataassimilation-jedi-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/)
framework.

Documentation is available at https://hpc-stack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. 

This is part of the [NCEPLIBS](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS) project.
