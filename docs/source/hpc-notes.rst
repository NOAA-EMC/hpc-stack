HPC-Stack Additional Notes
===========================

Setting compiler flags and other options
-----------------------------------------

Often it is necessary to specify compiler flags (e.g. ``gfortran-10
-fallow-argument-mismatch``) to the packages via ``FFLAGS``.  There are 2
ways this can be achieved.

1. For all packages: One can define variable e.g. ``STACK_FFLAGS=-fallow-argument-mismatch`` in the config file ``config_custom.sh``.  This will append ``STACK_FFLAGS`` to ``FFLAGS`` in every build script under libs.

2. Package specific flags: To compile only the specific package under ``libs`` with the above compiler flag, one can define variable ``FFLAGS=-fallow-argument-mismatch`` in the ``<package>`` section of the
YAML file ``stack_custom.yaml``. This will append ``STACK_<package>_FFLAGS`` to ``FFLAGS`` in the build script for that ``<package>`` only.

Adding a New Library or Package
--------------------------------

If you want to add a new library to the stack you need to follow these steps:

1. Write a new build script in libs, using exising scripts as a template

2. Define a new section in the ``yaml`` file for that library/package in config directory

3. If the package is a python virtual environment, add a ``requirements.txt`` or ``environment.yml`` file containing the listing the python packages required to install the package. These files should be named and placed in ``pyvenv/package_name.txt`` and ``pyvenv/package_name.yml``. ``VENVTYPE=pyvenv`` will use the ``pyvenv/package_name.txt`` and ``VENVTYPE=condaenv`` will use ``pyvenv/package_name.yml``

4. Add a call to the new build script in ``build_stack.sh``

5. Create a new module template at the appropriate place in the modulefiles directory, using exising files as a template

6. Update ``README.md`` to include the name of the new library or package

Configuring for a new HPC
---------------------------

If you want to port this to a new HPC, you need to follow these steps:

1. Write a new config file ``config/config_<hpc>.sh``, using existing configs as a template. Also create a new yaml file ``config/stack_<hpc>.yaml``, using existing yaml files as a template.

2. Add/remove basic modules for that HPC. 

3. Choose the appropriate Compiler/MPI combination.

4. If a template modulefile does not exist for that Compiler/MPI combinattion, create module templates at the appropriate place in the modulefiles directory, using existing files as a template. E.g. ``hpc-ips`` or ``hpc-smpi``.

5. If the HPC provides some basic modules for e.g. Git, CMake, etc. they can be loaded in ``config/config_<hpc>.sh``

Using the **DOWNLOAD_ONLY** Option
----------------------------------------

If an HPC (e.g. NOAA RDHPCS Hera) does not allow access to online software via ``wget`` or ``git clone``, you will have to download all the packages using the **DOWNLOAD_ONLY** option in the ``config_custom.sh``. Execute ``build_stack.sh`` as you would on a machine that does allow access to online software with ``DOWNLOAD_ONLY=YES`` and all the packages will be downloaded in the ``pkg`` directory.  Transfer the contents of the ``pkg`` directory to the machine you wish to install the hpc-stack and execute ``build_stack.sh``.  ``build_stack.sh`` will detect the already downloaded packages and use them rather than fetching them.

Using the HPC-stack
---------------------

* If Lmod is used to manage the software stack, to use the HPC-stack,
  you need to activate the stack.  This is done by loading the ``hpc``
  module under ``$PREFIX/modulefiles/stack`` as follows:

  .. code-block:: console

    module use $PREFIX/modulefiles/stack
    module load hpc/1.0.0

This will put the ``hpc-<compilerName>`` module in your ``MODULEPATH``,
which can be loaded as:

  .. code-block:: console

    module load hpc-<compilerName>/<compilerVersion>

* If the HPC-stack is not managed via modules, you need to add ``$PREFIX`` to the PATH as follows:

  .. code-block:: console
    
    export PATH="$PREFIX/bin:$PATH"
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
    export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$PREFIX"

Known Workaround for Certain Installations of Lmod
----------------------------------------------------

* On some machine's (e.g., **WCOSS_DELL_P3**), LMod is built to disable loading of default modulefiles and requires the user to load the module with an explicit version of the module.  e.g. ``module load netcdf/4.7.4`` instead of ``module load netcdf``. The latter looks for the ``default`` module which is either the latest version or a version that is marked as default.  To circumvent this, it is necessary to place the following lines in ``modulefiles/stack/hpc/hpc.lua`` prior to executing ``setup_modules.sh`` or in ``$PREFIX/modulefiles/stack/hpc/1.0.0.lua`` after executing ``setup_modules.sh``.

  .. code-block:: console
  
    -- https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/090_configuring_lmod.html
    setenv("LMOD_EXACT_MATCH", "no")
    setenv("LMOD_EXTENDED_DEFAULT", "yes")


Known Issues
===============

* NetCDF-C++ does not build with LLVM Clang. It can be disabled by setting ``disable_cxx: YES`` in the stack file under the NetCDF section.

* Json-schema-validator does not build with LLVM Clang. It can be disabled in the stack file in the json-schema-validator-section.
